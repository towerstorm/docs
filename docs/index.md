Want to create your own maps / minions / towers / abilities in Tower Storm? You've come to the right place. 

Tower Storm is a community driven game, it's all Open Source (Apache2 Licensed). So you can play with friends, host your own server, even create your own whole new TD game with very little programming knowledge required. 

## Getting Started

If you don't have a copy of Tower Storm running take a look at the [Getting Started instructions in the Tower Storm git repository](https://github.com/towerstorm/game#getting-started).  

All game config code is inside the `/config` folder. You'll want to use the Tower Storm `Sandbox` mode to see your changes. After making changes you only need to refresh your browser to see them in action. 

## Minions

All minion config files are in the `/config/minions` folder.
